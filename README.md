# Personal_development_map
This is a road map of my programming journey. As you see, whenever I complete a task, I click on a block in the given table.
## Contribution
The "Contribution" section represents my daily contribution to the github.com. I am going to commit a repository (a project) to github at least 5 times a week. When I commit something, I will mark the table.
### Learn something
The "Learn something" section can be anyhting that I learn (and will learn) on daily basis. For example, now, I am learning React.js. after completing it, I plan to learn Node.js as being a full stack developer is one of my top goals in my life.
